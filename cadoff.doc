                         --------------------------

NAME
     cadoff - disables the CTRL-ALT-DEL rebooting keys

SYNOPSIS
     There are no arguments by now; if you give any parameter, only an
     "about" window will be shown and the program will exit immediatly
     after that.

DESCRIPTION
     CAD/Off is a small utility that disables the CTRL-ALT-DEL key
     combination that normaly starts a reboot and enables it again after
     system shutdown, allowing to reboot the system then.

     Note 1: According to the documentations I have, the system function of
     the keyboard device that I use (and which is the only way to disable
     the rebooting keys) should also disable ALT+ESC and CTRL+ESC, thus
     making it a bit hard to switch between sessions. Fortunatly that never
     happened on my system. Maybe the working of this function has changed
     a bit with time and versions of OS/2. Just remember not to be
     suprised, if you experience that "feature" on your system.

     Note 2: AFAIK it is only possible to *toggle* the state of the keys,
     not explicitly set them to "disabled" or "enabled". So if you start
     the program, when the keys are already disabled (by some other program
     e.g.) or if you kill the program (there is currently no way to quit
     properly, other thhan through system shutdown) and start it again, the
     keys will then be *enabled*!
